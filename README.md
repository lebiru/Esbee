Esbee
=====

The Open Source Soundboard App for Android

How to Get
==========

From your Android device, go to [ninjabit.neocities.org/projects](ninjabit.neocities.org/projects) and click "Esbee". Your device will automatically download the app and install. 

Your device may throw a warning, asking for permission about downloading from Unknown Sources. Temporarily disable it so that Esbee could be downloaded, then re-enable it. 

How to Contribute
=================

Fork! 

You'll need the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) to make code changes. However, you don't need an Android device; an Android device emulator comes with the SDK. 

If you have any bugs, suggestions, or ideas, just create an issue. =)
